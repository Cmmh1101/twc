Seeing the potential to help more kids he brought this to the K-4 school he was working at, first during summer camps and eventually getting to work on a weekly basis with the kids as part of their curriculum. Eventually he decided to level up his game and started the self taught route, but needed a community and joined a bootcamp. Now he thinks and dreams in Javascript, using React for frontend, Node & Express for backend.",
